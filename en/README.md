>#### Introduction

This is an introduction edited by an idle person who has nothing to do, of course, the program is not played by me, by Mizuhara37, my buddy grunts all night, grunts out (all night grunts have lost several hairs, support it!). ï¼‰

We'll be adding more stuff in the future, so look forward to it!

> the development progress of ###

At present, Contrail Online is still in its infancy, whether it is in the interface or function will be slightly brief, after all, developers are currently in a relatively stressful learning environment, and can only be updated in the spare time after completing homework on the weekend.

Full development is expected to be completed in July 2023 and written in October 2022, a development cycle of almost a year.
